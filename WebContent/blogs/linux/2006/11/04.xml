		<blog:summary>
		Yesterday I upgraded our Dell Latitude to FC6, it was running FC4 and
		it was getting difficult to encounter some of the packages that I use
		on the desktop system (like <link external="http://www.twinklephone.com">Twinkle</link> for example).
		<para/>
		Well I can tell you that the installation went a <b>whole</b> lot better
		compared to the problems I had with the desktop machine!
		<para/>
		There was just one thing that bothered me. Where the desktop actually
		seemed faster (as it was supposed to according to
		<link external="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FC6ReleaseSummary">this</link>,
		see the Performance section) the latop felt sluggish somehow.
		</blog:summary>
		Applications were taking too long to load. When I tried measuring
		the drive's performance I got this:
		<code>
root# hdparm -t /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
Timing buffered disk reads:  48 MB in  3.65 seconds =  13.15 MB/sec
		</code>
		which is way too slow for that drive. Then I remembered that I had the
		same problem before with this laptop and it was because of the polling
		KDED did of the CD rom drive (to detect media changes and such).
		Stopping KDED (which you can do in the KDE Control Center -> KDE
		Components -> Service Manager) would solve the problem.
		<para/>
		But with FC6 this didn't seem to help. I found an option called
		<b>Enable CD polling</b> in the Peripherals -> Storage Media of the
		Control Center, but the option was grayed out so I couldn't change it.
		<para/>
		I finally found out today that it is <link external="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</link>
		which does the polling nowadays, specifically the hald-addon-storage
		module. Killing it restored the expected performance:
		<code>
root# hdparm -t /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
Timing buffered disk reads:  106 MB in  3.02 seconds =  35.15 MB/sec
		</code>
		So now it was time to figure out if something could be done about it.
		According to to <link external="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2005-April/002424.html">this forum message</link>
		it is a known problem with Dell laptops but it seems that the
		blacklisting it talks about doesn't work (anymore) in FC6.
		<para/>
		In the end I found out that HAL uses a set of rules to determine
		what to do with certain hardware which are stored in
		<b>/usr/share/hal/fdi</b>. By doing a <b>lshal</b> I could get a list
		of all the detected devices and find the information about the
		particular CD drive used in the laptop:

		Using the information above I created my own fdi file
		<b>information/30private/10-crappy-dell-cddrive.fdi</b>
		with the following rules:
		<code hilight="xml">
&lt;deviceinfo version="0.2"&gt;

  &lt;device&gt;

    &lt; Prevent polling on CD-Rom drive --&gt;
      &lt;match key="storage.model" string="HL-DT-STCD-RW/DVD-ROM GCC-4240N"&gt;
        &lt;merge key="storage.media_check_enabled" type="bool"&gt;false&lt;merge&gt;
      &lt;match&gt;

  &lt;device&gt;
&lt;deviceinfo&gt;
		</code>
		After restarting the HAL daemon (<b>service haldaemon restart</b>)
		everything was back to normal. Of course the system won't automatically
		detect any CDs being inserted into the drive, but I can live with that.
		(And yes, of course I filed a <link external="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=213995">bug report</link>)
