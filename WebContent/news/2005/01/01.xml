		Uploaded a new version of <link internal="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</link> (2.3.30) which fixes a minor problem
		with the tray icon status. It would continuously flash red after indicating an error if it was not able
		to contact the server even if it happened only once. It will now show the offline status icon like it should.
		I also fixed the URL that was opened when choosing Help from the pop-up menu (thanks to all those people that
		pointed that one out to me).
