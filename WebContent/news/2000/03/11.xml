		Well this is it. I finally decided to publish my new site. As we can see if
		we look at this page I started designing this site quite some time ago. More
		than 2 years actually! And then I just started doing other things and I just let
		this new design collect dust in a manner of speaking. But since I bought myself
		a digital camera (a Nikon Coolpix 950) in November last year I have steadily
		been putting more and more pictures on the website, stashed in some corner with
		no link to them. So this called for another decision to be made: would I or
		would I not allow the whole world to see all the pictures I've made? Well the
		result you can see right here on the "<link internal="/FotoAlbum/">My Photos</link>"
		page.
		<para/>
		So is the site finished? Well, of course not. First rule of a successful
		website is that it is <u>never</u> finished. But am I close to finished?
		Well.... uhhh... not really. There's still the introduction on the main page
		that is still non-existent and the same goes for the
		"<link internal="/TOI.jsp">My Interests</link>" section which is empty.
