		Added a "<link internal="/contact.jsp">Contact Me</link>" page containing things
		like address, telephone number (both normal and mobile), E-Mail and on top of that
		a panel that connects you directly to me when I'm on-line with ICQ. You can check
		my on-line status easily by looking at the flower image in the left-hand frame
		next to the "<link internal="/contact.jsp">Contact Me</link>" menu item: if it's
		green I'm on-line and by clicking on it you'll be transported directly to the
		ICQ Web Panel. I also added a form where you should have been able to write me a
		message that would be sent to my mobile phone, but my luck has it that the site
		that provided that service has locked out external sites from posting data because
		of several cases of abuse of their (free!) service . You could of course still go
		to <link external="http://www.mtnsms.com/">their site</link> and enter things
		manually, my <link internal="/contact.jsp">mobile phone number</link> is mentioned
		on the "<link internal="/contact.jsp">Contact Me</link>" page as well.
