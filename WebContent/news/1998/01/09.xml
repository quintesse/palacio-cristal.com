		First setup of my new site design. Still not much more than a couple of frames and
		lots of empty pages. I'm waiting for FrontPage 98 to start using style sheets and
		the like before I'll do much about the way these pages look. This is especially
		true for things like the What's New pages because of the differences between
		header and body text.
