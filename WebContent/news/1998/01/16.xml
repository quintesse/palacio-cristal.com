		Changed all the indexing pages because what I had in mind worked okay, until you
		started to use the back-button that is. You could actually see that more than one
		page was being loaded because pressing Back would restore each frame to its
		previous page on at a time. I wonder if there is a way to make IE (or any browser)
		see multiple loads as one. Well anyway, it's probably for the best because
		depending too much (or at all!) on scripts to navigate your site is bound to drive
		people away if they use a non-scriptable or buggy browser.
