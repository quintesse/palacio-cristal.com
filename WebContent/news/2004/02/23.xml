		Uploaded a new version of <link internal="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</link> (2.3.27)
		to fix a tiny bug which causes mayor problems. Due to a bug that has
		existed for some time some older versions of DeeEnEs have effectively
		started a DDOS attack on my website (laugh all you want, 10GB of traffic
		each week is <u>not</u> funny! Ok ok, so it <u>is</u> funny, but it is
		still a big problem that has to be solved).
		So everybody please upgrade now!
