		Uploaded a new version of <link internal="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</link> (2.3.29) and put a message
		on the home page asking people to upgrade because the home-made "DDOS attack" on the server
		was really getting out of hand (several Gigs worth of data in only 10 minutes!). The exact
		reason is not known and I'm not going to try to figure it out anymore. In a few days this site will
		only be reachable by the URL <b>www.palacio-cristal.com</b> while the old URL <i>palacio-cristal.com</i>
		will cease to work thereby cutting off all traffic generated by those old clients that are
		bringing the server to its knees. The new DeeEnEs client uses a new mechanism which will
		make it easier for me to control the traffic in the future.
