		Completely unexpected my father passed away yesterday after suffering a massive heart attack at 5 in the morning.
		When I got to him at 11 o' clock he was already sedated and sleeping in the Intensive Care.
		Doctors thought him stable at around 2 o' clock in the afternoon and thought it best for us to go home and rest
		a bit. Once at home we were told to return to the hospital immediately because his situation was worsening
		rapidly. He had already died when we arrived. I grieve not having been able to see him awake one last time
		and tell him how much I love him.
