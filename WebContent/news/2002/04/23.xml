		Uploaded a new version of <link internal="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</link> (2.3.22)
		which adds the latest DynDNS domains and repairs a bug in the HTTP protocol
		handling. <b>Update</b>: I want to give thanks to the enormous amount of people
		that warned me that the ZIP file I uploaded was corrupted. It's flattering to
		know so many people actually pay attention to the things I do <b>*grin*</b>.
