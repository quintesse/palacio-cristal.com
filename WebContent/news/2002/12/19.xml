		Uploaded a new version of <link internal="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</link> (2.3.25) which
		adds the DynDNS domains (isa-geek) that were still missing. Also took the
		opportunity to change the layout and coloring of the site a bit. Now uses a lot
		more CSS and should also work on Mozilla/Netscape 7 browsers.
