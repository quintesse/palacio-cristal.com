<p>This section contains all the programs I ever wrote that I found interesting enough to
include on my site. All the programs here are either finished or at least out of beta,
other projects I'm working on that are not finished yet or still in a conceptual stage can
be found in the <a href="/projects/">Current Projects</a> section.</p>

<p>The following programs can be found here:</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><h2><a href="eaccent/">Easy Accent</a></h2>
    <p align="left">A small program that enables you to easily enter international characters
    and special symbols not found on your keyboard.</td>
    <td width="10" nowrap></td>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" nowrap></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" nowrap></td>
    <td width="10" nowrap></td>
    <td width="50%"><h2><a href="DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</a></h2>
    <p align="left">Is just one of the programs that are written by people who
    have an account at one of the many sites that offer dynamic DNS services,
    like the one I use: <a href="http://www.dyndns.org" target="_blank">www.dyndns.org</a>
    and who need a way to have their IP addresses automatically updated. There
    are quite a few of these programs out there, I just didn't like any of them.
    That's the only reason for DeeEnEs' existence, not because I think it's
    brilliant, but I just didn't like the &quot;competition&quot;.</td>
