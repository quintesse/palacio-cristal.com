<div class="header">1. Which update method should I choose? Modem, LAN
or
Web-based?</div>
<div class="text">This depends on your particular situation, but let's
start by saying
that Web-based will
work in <u>any</u> situation so to test if you've configured
everything correctly you could
start by selecting that one.</div>
<div class="text">But now for the actual explanation. You should only
choose Modem or
LAN if your computer
is <u>directly</u> connected to the internet and has a publicly
accessible IP address.
If you're behind a firewall or using a NAT-capable router or access the
internet using an
ADSL or Cable Modem you will must likely <u>not</u> have a publicly
accessible IP address.
The only option left will be Web-based udates.</div>
<div class="text">So what is the difference? Well with the Modem and
LAN update
methods DeeEnEs can detect
any changes in your IP adress almost instantly while the Web-based
method can take up to
10 minutes in a worst-case scenario (see question #2 below). If you add
to that the normal
delay of the
internet when you change IP addresses (see question #3 below) it can
take almost
half an hour between the moment your IP actually changed and the moment
everybody
in the world can access your domain again.</div>
</div>
<div class="history">
<div class="header">2. I know my IP address has changed so why is
DeeEnEs not
updating?</div>
<div class="text">You are probably using the Web-based update method.
When using this
method
DeeEnEs periodically checks with an external server to see if your IP
address
has changed. To prevent DeeEnEs from putting too much strain on that
server
it will never check more than once every 10 minutes. So in a worst-case
scenario it can take up to 10 minutes before DeeEnEs notices that your
IP
address has changed. If you are <u>really</u> sure that your IP
address has
changed you can select <b>Force Update</b> from the tray icon's pop-up
menu.</div>
</div>
<div class="history">
<div class="header">3. DeeEnEs says it updated successfully so why
isn't my
domain working?</div>
<div class="text">This most likely has to do with the way the internet
works. Changes
to IP addresses
take some time to propagate around the world. You can read <a
 href="http://www.dyndns.org/services/dyndns/faq.html#19">here</a> what
the people over
at DynDNS have to say about it.</div>
</div>
<div class="history">
<div class="header">4. DeeEnEs updated successfully hours ago so why is
my
domain still not working?</div>
<div class="text">The first thing you can do is check what your
computer thinks is the
IP adress if
your domain. To do this you can open a Command Window (select Run...
from the Start menu,
type <b>cmd</b> and click Ok) and type <b>ping yourdomain.dyndns.org</b>.
You should
change <b>yourdomain.dyndns.org</b> to the domain that you registered
of course. You should get an output looking like this:
</div>
<pre>Pinging yourdomain.dyndns.org [<span style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>] with 32 bytes of data:<br><br>Reply from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>: bytes=32 time=18ms TTL=249<br>Reply from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>: bytes=32 time=18ms TTL=249<br>Reply from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>: bytes=32 time=27ms TTL=249<br>Reply from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=249<br><br>Ping statistics for <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</span>:<br>    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br>    Minimum = 15ms, Maximum = 27ms, Average = 19ms<br></pre>
<div class="text">Where <b>nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</b> is the IP address that
is connected to
your domain according to your computer. Now compare that with the IP
address
you get when going to <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org/">this</a>
page.
If they are not the same you should double-check your account settings
in DeeEnEs
and see if it really updated. Check this by going into the Accounts
dialog and
selecting the account: the <b>enabled</b> option should be checked and
the
message in the middle should say Updated successfully with a recent
date.
Try selecting <b>Check now</b> from the tray icon's pop-up menu to see
what happens.
Check the log window for any errors or other message that might explain
what is going on.
</div>
<div class="text">If the two IP addresses <u>are</u> the same DeeEnEs
works perfectly
and there is probably some other reason for your problem. The most
likely
problem that many people encounter is that they are trying to run a web
or FTP server on their computer but can't access it. The reason for
this
most of the time is that fact that they are behind a firewall (either
on their
own computer, on their network or even their ISP) that is blocking
incoming
traffic from the internet. It's outside the scope of this FAQ to
explain
how to solve those problems. Try Google or a friend with some good
understanding
of firewalls and such.

<div class="header">5. I get "Permission denied, program is in use"
when trying
to upgrade. What is wrong?</div>
<div class="text">You are probably trying to copy the new DeeEnEs.exe
over the old one
while
it is still running. This is not possible in Windows (it is not Linux
afterall)
so you first have to exit the currently running version DeeEnEs before
copying the new file. To do this just right-click on the DeeEnEs tray icon
and select Exit from the menu. Now copy the new <b>DeeEnEs.exe</b> over the
old one and re-start the program by double-clicking it. 
<br>
If you can't remember
where you left the old version, don't worry, just copy the program to any
location you want and start it. This will ensure that from now on the
new version will be used. If at any time in the future you come across the
old version again you can safely delete it.</div>

<div class="history">
<div class="header">6. Is it possible to run DeeEnEs as a service?</div>
<div class="text">DeeEnEs does in fact have the capability to run as a
service. It's
just not advertised because it still doesn't work like it should.
Why? Well, you can't change any of its settings while it runs as a
service for example!
So the only option would be to run it normally, make sure all the
settings are okay, exit and then install it as a service.
Installing it as a service is easy, you just start it from a command
line with the option <b>/INSTALL</b>
But if you need to change anything you will need to stop the service or
even uninstall it (using <b>/UNINSTALL</b>),
run it normally, change the settings and reinstall as a service.
As you can see this is not very user-friendly.
But if you really want to you can go ahead and use it.
