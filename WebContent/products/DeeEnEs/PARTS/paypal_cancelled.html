	No DeeEnEs Donator
</div>
<br>

<h3>You decided to cancel your DeeEnEs donation!</h3>

<p>But don't worry, there is no need to feel bad because DeeEnEs was written for 
fun and not for any commercial gain. So even without your donation DeeEnEs will 
remain completely functional. I hope you'll continue to find DeeEnEs a useful 
little program and if you at some time in the future should decide that DeeEnEs 
really is worth a donation you can always <a href="Default.htm#Donation">try 
again</a>.</p>
