<ul>
<li>Made a new version that uses a slightly different mechanism to check for a new version.
The old mechanism will only work for a few more days now to give everyone the chance to update.
After that the old mechanism (and the old URL http://palacio-cristal.com) will be turned off.
This is necessary because some old clients somewhere in the world or still bombarding my server
with requests and generating insane amounts of traffic.</li>

The /AUTOEXIT option now works again, preliminary code to make DeeEnEs work as a service seems to work and
a new language resource DLL for Spanish has been made available thanks to Josh Feldman. The service code can be
tested by using the command-line options /INSTALL and /UNINSTALL but the problem right now is that there is no
user interface available when running as a service so for normal use you will have to wait for a future version
of DeeEnEs that properly implements this feature.

Improved error handling. Will now show the reason why an account failed to update in the accounts dialog.
Finally supports the DynDNS Custom domains. The options dialog has a DynDNS donator option that will enable/disable
certain options that are only available to donators. Added several new domains (dyndns.tv, dyndns.ws and orgdns.org).
Hopefully fixed the bug that would make the try icon flash red even when all accounts were updated successfully.

The local check for Modem and LAN connection will be done less often now. This in addition to lowered thread priorities will
make sure DeeEnEs consumes as little CPU time as possible. The accounts dialog has had a makeover to make it more intuitive (hopefully),
thanks to Nikita Visnevski for the new design. Turning on Detailed Logging will now give a warning and restarting DeeEnEs will
automatically turn it off again. This to prevent people who have this turned on by default to start complaining about
excessivly large log files.

Not thoroughly tested yet but you'll be doing the maintainers of DynDNS a big favour
if you switch to this version!

Added web based IP checking. At this moment you'll be able to use two DynDNS based IP checks and one
that is available at the DeeEnEs website. Fixed some bugs as well: a version check would be done after
a startup even when the option was cleared in the properties dialog. And turning on the Backup MX option
would not work (it never had!) Thanks to Jan Groene for pointing these out to me.

DeeEnEs will now automatically force an update after a set number of days (defaults to 28) to ensure that your account won't be deleted.

A new option was added to delay the first update after DeeEnEs was started,
this way dail-up connections get some time to initialize. DeeEnEs will now also
ignore the known private IP ranges in the Interface dropdown box in the
preferences dialog. Something strange might seem to happen if you had previously
selected an interface which currently isn't active: the Interface dropdown will
be empty, but you can just leave it like that, DeeEnEs will remember which
interface was selected. Thanks to Helmchen for
the help.

Added a command-line option <b>/AUTOEXIT</b> that will automatically exit the

the client from a batch file or from within tools that detect when you connect

the suggestion.

Fixed a bug that would crash the client on a regular basis. Adds even more
extended logging as well. Now also writes this log to a file (DeeEnEs.log in the
same directory as the .exe), the log file is even more detailed than the log in
the log window. Was never made into a public version. Thanks to Helmchen for making me aware of the problem.

Added automatic version checking. DeeEnEs will now check for a new version
once a day and will display a message giving you the option to open the download
page if a newer version than the one you have was found. An option to turn
version checking on and off can be found in the properties dialog. Another new
option can be found there as well: detailed logging. This will add more detailed
messages to the log window (actually this is the same as the logging was in the
pre-1.2 version of DeeEnEs).

Accounts can now be anabled and disabled by setting or clearing the update option in the accounts dialog.
Accounts will be disabled automatically whenever an error was returned by the
site for which an update was requested. This goes for accounts blocked due to
abuse as well as invalid user names or passwords and mistyped host names. The
log will now show less detailed messages because normally the log would be
swamped with &quot;updating...&quot; messages drowning out the interesting ones.
