<h3><a name="Introduction">How to help translate DeeEnEs in your language</a></h3>

<p>Do you want to help translate DeeEnEs into your own language (or any other 
language with which you are sufficiently fluent)? Then I will explain to you 
what you must do:</p>

<ol>
  <li class="largenum"><a href="index.jsp#Download">Download the sources</a>.</li>
  <li class="largenum">Extract them to your hard disk and locate the 
  <b>english_resources_template</b> folder.</li>
  <li class="largenum">Make a copy of the template folder renaming it to <b>&lt;your_language&gt;_resources</b>.</li>
  <li class="largenum">In the new folder edit the project file (DeeEnEs_lang.dsp) with a text 
  editor and replace all occurrences of <b>YourLanguage</b> with the <u>English</u> 
  name of the language you are translating to. </li>
  <li class="largenum">Do the translation. There are several ways possible ways 
  you can go about making the translation:
	<ol>
		<li><b>You have Visual C++</b>. This is the recommended way. You just 
        open the project file that you edited in step 4 en start translating the 
        dialogs, menus and strings. The good thing about doing it this way is 
        that you can easily change positions and sizes of the labels and 
        controls to them to the needs of the language you are translating to.</li>
		<li><b>You will use a text editor</b>. This will be harder to do for 
        you. All the strings are buried between lots of other information like 
        menu and dialog definitions and lots of numbers and identifiers. The 
        second problem is that you can't see when a string needs a little bit 
        more space and therefore a button needs to grow or an edit control moved 
        a bit. It also means that I have to go over the result to the adjusting 
        for you and it will most likely take some time before I'll be able to 
        publish the result to the website.</li>
	</ol>
  </li>
  <li>Send me the <b>DeeEnEs_lang.rc</b> file.</li>
</ol>

<p>What if you don't have Visual C++ and don't want to mess about with a text 
editor but you have <b>another resource editor</b>? This has the same advantage 
as using Visual C++ of being able to adjust the labels and controls to the texts 
you are writing. It has the disadvantage that it is more work for me to finally 
integrate it with the entire DeeEnEs project and it will therefore be probable 
that I will take a bit longer before being able to publish it on the website. If 
you do it this way you:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="Default.htm#Download">Download the program</a>.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Load the DeeEnEs.exe into your resource editor and translate the 
  texts.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Send me the adjusted executable (in a ZIP file please, Outlook 
  blocks unsafe attachments).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Some things to think about</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Don't make the strings much longer than the English original, this will 
  prevent you (or me) from having to make too much changes to the layout of the 
  dialogs.</li>
  <li>Try to be as concise as possible. Especially for buttons and labels you 
  should try to use as few words and letters as possible without becoming 
  unclear.</li>
  <li>Use abbreviations only where necessary (or use very commonly used 
  abbreviations only).</li>
  <li>Try to stay as close to the original English meaning as possible but don't 
  always translate too literally.</li>
  <li>There are some places in the resources (especially the <b>Version</b> 
  section) where you will encounter the word <b>[YourLanguage]</b>, of course 
  you should enter the name of the language you are translating to.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Version</b> section of the resource file you can put your own 
  name in the <b>Comments</b> field (don't leave <b>Your Name Here</b> in 
  there!). You should preferably leave this section in English.</li>
</ul>
