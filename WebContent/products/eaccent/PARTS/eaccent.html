<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered why you can't enter international characters and special symbols
in every Windows program as easily as you can in most word processors like Word for
example? Maybe you're thinking now: &quot;but what about using an international key map?&quot;. True, that is a possible solution, but one that I was not really satisfied
with. Why? Well with an international key map you'll get an international letter every time
you type an accent followed by a letter, even if this is <u>not</u> what you wanted. What
if you wanted to type <strong>'a good idea'</strong>? You'd get <strong>á good idea'</strong>,
obviously not what you'd want. The way to prevent this would be by typing a space between
the accent and the letter and delete the space afterwards.</p>

<p>This is where <strong>Easy Accent</strong> comes in: it will let you enter
international characters just as easily as you would in Word or Word Perfect but without
all the silly problems that you get when using international key maps. You just hold down
the CTRL key while typing an accent and a letter and presto!</p>
