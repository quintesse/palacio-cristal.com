		Uploaded a new version of <a href="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</a> (2.3.30) which fixes a minor problem
		with the tray icon status. It would continuously flash red after indicating an error if it was not able
		to contact the server even if it happened only once. It will now show the offline status icon like it should.
		I also fixed the URL that was opened when choosing Help from the pop-up menu (thanks to all those people that
		pointed that one out to me).

		Uploaded a new version of <a href="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</a> (2.3.29) and put a message
		on the home page asking people to upgrade because the home-made "DDOS attack" on the server
		was really getting out of hand (several Gigs worth of data in only 10 minutes!). The exact
		reason is not known and I'm not going to try to figure it out anymore. In a few days this site will
		only be reachable by the URL <b>www.palacio-cristal.com</b> while the old URL <i>palacio-cristal.com</i>
		will cease to work thereby cutting off all traffic generated by those old clients that are
		bringing the server to its knees. The new DeeEnEs client uses a new mechanism which will
		make it easier for me to control the traffic in the future.

		also available in the Catalan language. And last but certainly not least as of today DeeEnEs is
		released under the GPL!

		Completely unexpected my father passed away yesterday after suffering a massive heart attack at 5 in the morning.
		When I got to him at 11 o' clock he was already sedated and sleeping in the Intensive Care.
		Doctors thought him stable at around 2 o' clock in the afternoon and thought it best for us to go home and rest
		a bit. Once at home we were told to return to the hospital immediately because his situation was worsening
		rapidly. He had already died when we arrived. I grieve not having been able to see him awake one last time
		and tell him how much I love him.

A new program to update dynamic DNS accounts <a href="/products/DeeEnEs/">DeeEnEs</a> can now be <a href="/products/DeeEnEs"> downloaded</a> from the website.

Well this is it. I finally decided to publish my new site. As we can see if
we look at this page I started designing this site quite some time ago. More
than 2 years actually! And then I just started doing other things and I just let
this new design collect dust in a manner of speaking. But since I bought myself
a digital camera (a Nikon Coolpix 950) in November last year I have steadily
been putting more and more pictures on the website, stashed in some corner with
no link to them. So this called for another decision to be made: would I or
would I not allow the whole world to see all the pictures I've made? Well the
result you can see right here on the &quot;<a href="/FotoAlbum/">My Photos</a>&quot;
page.
<p>
So is the site finished? Well, of course not. First rule of a successful
website is that it is <u>never</u> finished. But am I close to finished?
Well.... uhhh... not really. There's still the introduction on the main page
that is still non-existent and the same goes for the &quot;<a href="/TOI.jsp">My
Interests</a>&quot; section which is empty.

Added a &quot;<a href="/contact.jsp">Contact Me</a>&quot; page containing things like
address, telephone number (both normal and mobile), E-Mail and on top of that a panel that
connects you directly to me when I'm on-line with ICQ. You can check my on-line status
easily by looking at the flower image in the left-hand frame next to the &quot;<a href="/contact.jsp">Contact
Me</a>&quot; menu item: if it's green I'm on-line and by clicking on it you'll be transported
directly to the ICQ Web Panel. I also added a form where you should have been able to
write me a message that would be sent to my mobile phone, but my luck has it that the site
that provided that service has locked out external sites from posting data because of
several cases of abuse of their (free!) service . You could of course still go to
<a href="http://www.mtnsms.com/">their site</a> and enter things manually, my <a href="/contact.jsp">mobile phone number</a> is mentioned on the &quot;<a href="/contact.jsp">Contact
Me</a>&quot; page as well.

Changed all the indexing pages because what I had in mind worked okay, until you
started to use the back-button that is. You could actually see that more than one page was
being loaded because pressing Back would restore each frame to its previous page on at a
time. I wonder if there is a way to make IE (or any browser) see multiple loads as one.
Well anyway, it's probably for the best because depending too much (or at all!) on scripts
to navigate your site is bound to drive people away if they use a non-scriptable or buggy
browser.

First setup of my new site design. Still not much more than a couple of frames and lots
of empty pages. I'm waiting for FrontPage 98 to start using style sheets and the like
before I'll do much about the way these pages look. This is especially true for things
like the What's New pages because of the differences between header and body text.
