Could still get a good price for my D30 so I thought why not go for the double resolution and the quicker shutter release?
No other good reason actually and luckily I've had no reason to regret the decision because the camera really is great!<br><br>

<a name="d30"><h3>My Third Camera</h3></a>

This is the third digital camera that I now own. Photos taken after November 2001
will most likely be taken with this camera although my girlfriend is now using
the Nikon 990 so you might still see some pictures one the site from that camera
as well. So why did I change this time? Well actually I always wanted a SLR
camera because of the feeling of looking through the lens and actually seeing
what the final result will be. But before I took the step of changing my
point-and-click camera for an SLR there came along the digital cameras and I was
hooked on the ease of use and the incredible turnaround time of making a picture
and having the result on the computer a couple of minutes later. But the more
and more I worked with the two Nikons below the more I also realised the
inherent limitations of a fixed-lens camera. So I started looking at those
&quot;add-on&quot; lenses that you can put on the front of the existing lens and they
actually work quite well, but in the back of my mind the fact that I had always
wanted an SLR kept nagging me. Of course I had looked at the professional
digital SLRs like the Nikon D1 but the resolution of that camera's CCD was
actually a lot less than my Nikon 990. But the price was the real reason I never
looked twice at that camera, it was <u>way</u> out of my budget. Until I
encountered the Canon EOS D30. Now here was a camera that at least did
everything at least as good as my own camera and was actaully an SLR! But the
price was still way too high for me, especially because I would need all those
lenses and other stuff as well. And at the same time my Nikon 990 was still
performing spectacularly. So I laid that wish to rest hoping that at one time in
the future digital SLRs would become a lot more affordable. So why did I buy it
now when the price is still almost as high as ever? Well I just became lucky,
that's all, there was this deal I could make and I just grabbed the opportunity
before it would go away.<br><br>

This is the second digital camera I bought. All photos taken after May 2000 are taken with this camera. I only
had the 950 for little over 6 months when I decided to go for the 990. Why? Well the higher resolution was nice
of course but one of the main reasons I bought it was the USB connection the 990 has. I had bought a CompactFlash
card reader (SanDisk) and that performs really well, but I didn't want to take it with me wherever I go. The camera
is already enough of a burden if you have it with you almost every day of the year. The second reason was the brighter
(albeit smaller) display which is much better to use in sunlight. The camera isn't perfect though. In my opinion it
is still missing infrared distance measuring for focusing in low light conditions.

<a name="coolpix950"><h3>My First Camera</h3></a>

My First Digital Camera. One word: incredible! Making photos with a digital camera turned out to be so much fun.
Sure, it won't give you the same quality pictures we've grown used to, even compared to normal consumer cameras,
but boy it is easy to use! Maybe people wo are really into photography won't realte to this, but always when I
was making pictures with a normal camera I would try not to <i>waste</i> any film. So if I was somewhere special I
would make a couple of pictures and <i>save</i> the rest for the next occasion. But you could never know if your
picture would come out the way you had intended. Again, professionals with years of experience might not have
this problem, but I'm just an amateur. So being able to make a dozen pictures of a subject until you get a couple
of them <i>just right</i> and then deleting the others on the spot is just plain cool. It completely changes the
way you make photos. The second thing I would always do (especially as a student with little money to spend) was
wait until I would have used all the film before having it developed. So if I would go on a small trip with a
fresh film and come back with 5 pictures taken I would wait until I had used the rest of the film before developing
it. Which could be the next holidays 10 months later. Of course this makes for nice surprises when you get your
photos and there are some that you had forgotten about, but it is not what I wanted. Having a digital camera
changes that as well. You go somewhere, make some pictures, come home, plug your camera into your computer et
voila, there they are. No waiting. No hassle. Now the only thing I'm waiting for is a cheap way to get my pictures
onto paper (for people without computer like my parents).

<h3>Software downloads</h3>

Putting Nikon's software and drivers here is probably illegal, but come on Nikon if I take my camera somewhere
I don't want to have to carry the CD with me every time as well! I've paid enough for the damn thing anyway so
the software shouldn't be so difficult to get. Talking about paying enough: the software sucks. How on earth
a large company like Nikon can charge you that much money for a camera and write software as bad as Nikon View
is beyond me.<br>
